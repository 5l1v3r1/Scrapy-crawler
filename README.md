# ScrapyDalinHuang

In any language and using any framework or libraries you feel comfortable with, please write a
simple tool that will scrape product information from http://www.visions.ca/, returning at a
minimum the following information:<br>
    • The product categories available on the website<br>
	• At least one product per category<br><br>
Each product returned should have the following information:<br>
	• Product title<br>
	• Product sale or regular price where applicable<br>
	• Product availability<br><br>
As a bonus (but not doing this will not count against you), you may want to use the following
your solution:<br>
	• Python<br>
	• The scrapy, lxml, or requests python libraries<br>
	• Xpaths or CSS selectors<br>
